# Description of the plugin.
description=Implements a way to control two PWM signals for the purpose of setting the level in an LED light bulb.  Tied, somewhat artificially, to PA6 and PA7, although it would be easy to edit the code given the examples to use different GPIO PWM outputs.  Need to tie this in to the level control cluster.
